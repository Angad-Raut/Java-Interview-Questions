Java 8 Interview Questions and Answers

Q.1 What is Java 8?
    - Java 8 is a major release of the Java programming language 
      that majorly changed the old style of programming by introducing several new features, 
      such as, lambda expressions, functional interfaces, and streams. 

Q.2 What is a lambda expression?
    - A lambda expression is a short way to express a function in Java. 
      It allows us to write a function inline and pass it as an argument to another function as well.

Q.3 What is a functional interface?
    - A functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. 
      It is used to represent a single function contract.

Q.4 What is a stream in Java 8?
    - A stream is a sequence of elements that can be processed parallel or sequentially. 
      Streams are a new addition to Java 8 and provide an easy way to work with collections.

Q.5 What are the benefits of using streams?
    - Streams provide a more concise and demonstrative way to work with collections. 
      They also enable parallel processing of collections, which can lead to improved performance.

Q.6 What is the difference between a parallel stream and a sequential stream in Java 8?
    - A parallel stream allows for processing elements concurrently using multiple threads,
      while a sequential stream processes elements one-by-one in a single thread. 
      To create a parallel stream, you can call the parallel() method on a stream.

Q.7 What is the difference between a stream and a collection in Java 8?
    - A stream is a sequence of elements that can be processed in parallel or sequentially,
      while a collection is a data structure that stores a group of elements. 
      Additionally, Streams provide an easy way to work with Collections.

Q.8 What are the common terminal operations on streams?
    - Some common terminal operations on streams include forEach(), 
      reduce(), collect(), min(), max(), findFirst(), findAny() and count() etc.

Q.9 What is the difference between a terminal operation and an intermediate operation in a stream?
    - An intermediate operation on a stream returns a new stream, 
      while a terminal operation consumes the stream and produces a result.

Q.10 What is the difference between a functional interface and a normal interface in Java 8?
    - A functional interface contains only one abstract method, 
      while a normal interface can contain any number of abstract methods.

Q.11 What is a default method in Java 8?
    - A default method is a method with the ‘default’ keyword that is defined in an interface and has a default implementation. 
      It can be overridden by an implementing class if needed.

Q.12 What is a static method in Java 8?
    - A static method is a method with the ‘static’ keyword that is defined in a class 
      and can be called without creating an instance of the class.

Q.13 What is the syntax for a lambda expression in Java 8?
     - The syntax for a lambda expression in Java 8 is:
       (parameter list) -> expression

Q.14 What is the difference between a lambda expression and an anonymous inner class in Java 8?
     - A lambda expression is a concise way to express a function,
       while an anonymous inner class is a way to create a class without giving it a name.

Q.15 What is a method reference in Java 8?
     - A method reference is a shorthand way to write a lambda expression that calls a method.
        Method references can be used to simplify code and improve readability by eliminating the need for a separate lambda expression.
        For example, instead of using “x -> Math.sqrt(x)”, we can use “Math::sqrt” as a method reference.
